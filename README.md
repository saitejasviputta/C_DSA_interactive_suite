# C_DSA_interactive_suite

A modular, console-based **Data Structures & Algorithms library** written entirely in **C**, built from scratch with pointer-level control, manual memory management (`malloc` / `free`), and defensive input validation.

This project emphasizes **conceptual clarity**, **low-level fundamentals**, and **explicit memory reasoning**. It is designed with an educational intent, allowing learners to observe, experiment with, and understand data structures and algorithms step-by-step through an interactive terminal-based interface.

The codebase is structured as a reusable **DSA core**, with an interactive, console-driven **demo layer** built on top.

## Build Instructions (Recommended)

This project includes a **Makefile** to simplify building across multiple directories.

### Requirements
- GNU Make ≥ 3.81
- GCC (or a compatible C compiler)

### Build
```bash
make
```

This generates a single executable:

* `dsa` (Linux / macOS)
* `dsa.exe` (Windows)

### Clean

```bash
make clean
```

---

## Manual Build (Without Make)

### Linux / macOS

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -g \
-Isrc/data_structures \
-Isrc/expression_evaluation \
-Isrc/sorting_algorithms_n2 \
-Isrc/advanced_sorting_algorithms \
-Isrc/searching_algorithms \
-Isrc/graph_traversals \
-Isrc/hashing \
src/data_structures/*.c \
src/expression_evaluation/*.c \
src/sorting_algorithms_n2/*.c \
src/advanced_sorting_algorithms/*.c \
src/searching_algorithms/*.c \
src/graph_traversals/*.c \
src/hashing/*.c \
-o dsa
```

### Windows

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -g ^
-Isrc/data_structures ^
-Isrc/expression_evaluation ^
-Isrc/sorting_algorithms_n2 ^
-Isrc/advanced_sorting_algorithms ^
-Isrc/searching_algorithms ^
-Isrc/graph_traversals ^
-Isrc/hashing ^
src/data_structures/*.c ^
src/expression_evaluation/*.c ^
src/sorting_algorithms_n2/*.c ^
src/advanced_sorting_algorithms/*.c ^
src/searching_algorithms/*.c ^
src/graph_traversals/*.c ^
src/hashing/*.c ^
-o dsa.exe
```

This mirrors exactly what the Makefile performs.

## Continuous Integration

[![CI](https://github.com/darshan2456/C_DSA_interactive_suite/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/darshan2456/C_DSA_interactive_suite/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This project includes a **GitHub Actions CI pipeline** that automatically verifies code correctness and memory safety.

On every push or pull request:

1. A fresh **Ubuntu VM** is allocated
2. The project is **compiled using GCC**
3. The complete **unit test suite is executed**
4. All test binaries are run under **Valgrind** to check for:

   - memory leaks  
   - invalid reads / writes  
   - use-after-free errors  
   - uninitialized memory usage

If any test fails or Valgrind detects a memory error, the CI job fails automatically.

## Project Overview

### Data Structures
- Singly Linked List (SLL)
- Doubly Linked List (DLL)
- Circular Queue (array-based)
- Stack (array-based / linked-list-based as required)
- Binary Search Tree (BST)-recursive
- Threaded Binary Tree (TBT)
- Priority Queue(heap based)

### Algorithms

#### Expression Processing
- Step-by-step visualization for Infix → Postfix conversion
- Step-by-step visualization for Postfix expression evaluation

#### Searching
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

#### Sorting (O(n²) family)
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

#### Advanced Sorting Algorithms
- Quick sort
- Merge sort

#### Graph Traversals
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra's algorithm

Graph traversals are implemented using:
- An adjacency list representation
- An explicit queue for BFS
- An explicit stack for DFS
- A priority queue for Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

Both BFS and DFS are implemented **iteratively** (no recursion).


#### Hashing Algorithms
-Linear Probing
-Separate Chaining

Linear Probing uses modulo arithmetic to wrap-around the hash table/array when last index is full, optimizing resources and using the full array. 
Separate Chaining uses sll API from the 'data_structures' folder

## Project Features

### Graph Traversals (BFS & DFS)

* Graphs are represented using an adjacency list
* BFS uses the circular queue from the `data_structures` module
* DFS uses an explicit stack from the `expression_evaluation` module
* `visited[]` invariants are strictly enforced
* Traversals are iterative (non-recursive)
* Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs
* Priority Queue support for graph algorithms


### Priority Queue

* Heap-based implementation
* Efficient insertion and removal operations
* Reusable component for graph algorithms and future extensions

---

### Expression Evaluation

* Implementation lives in `expression_evaluation`
* Converts infix expressions to postfix notation using:

  * operator precedence
  * parentheses handling

* Step-by-step visualization of infix-to-postfix conversion, showing the operator stack and current output at each step
* Step-by-step visualization of postfix evaluation, showing operand stack updates and intermediate results
* Includes a parentheses checker with validated input via `safe_input_int()` to ensure well-formed expressions before processing
---

### Modularity & Header Discipline

The codebase follows strict modular design rules:
* Unified header used in data_structures.
* One `.h` / `.c` pair per logical module
* No function definitions inside headers
* No duplicate symbols across translation units
* Explicit namespacing via function prefixes
* C11-compliant code ensuring portable and standard-safe compilation.



Each directory acts as an independent module, making the system easy to extend, debug, or refactor.

---

### Language Features Used Deliberately

* `static` for file-local helper functions
* `const` for API correctness and pointer safety
* Macro `INPUT_EXIT_SIGNAL` (defined in `safe_input.h`) for:

  * Consistent exit signaling
  * Uniform validation behavior

---

### Robust Input Validation

All user input across the entire application is handled via:

```
safe_input_int()
```

Validation is implemented through custom-built helper functions, not ad-hoc checks.

Examples include:

* Infix expression validation (`validate_infix_expr`)

  * Allowed tokens
  * Balanced parentheses
* Postfix expression validation (`validate_postfix_expr`)

  * Stack depth invariants
* Numeric range validation for searching, sorting, and graph input

Invalid input:

* Cannot crash the program
* Is rejected, cleaned, and retried safely
